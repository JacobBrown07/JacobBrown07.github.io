            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>My dream career isn't blatantly obvious as of right now but I have always wanted to program. So I wish to become someone highly successful in the programming world with the skill equivalent or greater than a senior level programmer. Then at some point I hope to have some family so when I retire I have people around me until I die and can leave a huge sum of money to my kids for them to take care of themselves and their family.</p>

                <p> Residents are having their belongings touched in the public washers and dryers of the dorm rooms. This is all due to people being impatient and thus peoples belongings end up placed somewhere they didn't put it.</p>
