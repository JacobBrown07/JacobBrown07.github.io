            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>My dream career isn't blatantly obvious as of right now but I have always wanted to program. So I wish to become someone highly successful in the programming world with the skill equivalent or greater than a senior level programmer. Then at some point I hope to have some family so when I retire I have people around me until I die and can leave a huge sum of money to my kids for them to take care of themselves and their family.</p>

                <p>The sidewalks on campus are in need of repairs. The concrete sidewalks are cracked and the brick paths have many loose bricks. This is unsafe for bikers, skaters, and even walkers.</p>
